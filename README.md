## This is our solution for the  [Appwrite 2022 Hackathon on Dev](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-appwrite-hackathon-on-dev-1oc0)

We had quite alot of fun building this project within the timeframe stipulated for it.

## About

The appwrite hackathon has four different categories that participants are allowed to provide solution to. 
My team and I worked on the Web2 Wizard category. This category focuses on building an application using any of Appwrite’s tools that services the internet as we know it today and its users.
The most key feature of the hackathon is to integrate app write as the backend service for the application.

My team and I developed a solution called Tracker. 


### Problem statement
Alot of times we tend to write down application on journal and sometimes, we tend to forget to push out those applications. Sometimes we add it to google calendar but alot of times we get overwhelmed with trying to keep up with all the applications added. At the end of the year most times, we look back at our growth and try to reflect on the job applications and events or fellowships we've applied to and sometimes we give an estimated number. Won't it be nice to actually have the correct figures of all these? 

### Solution
That is the main goal of tracker. A web app that enables user to keep track of their applications. 
It also enables users to add their applications and keep track of them. Tracker helps users to store their applications and ensure that they get back to them through timely email reminders (though this is still a feature in progress at the moment). 

### Future Integrations
No product is ever built in a day and awesome products that addresses users needs goes through updates regularly. As regards that, we've plans of improving our products and we'll accept pull requests on solutions that addresses any of the issues below as that is our next target goal.
* timely email reminders to users
* allowing users to subscribe to emails
* improving the feeds section of our application
* integrating in and out of google calendar to enable users to fix calendar invites whenever they want to
* sending related articles to users based on the kind of application they have saved on their dashboard

## Architecture
The backend was deisgned with appwrite as that is the main goal of the hackathon.
