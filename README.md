# Tracker âœ”

### Problem statement
Alot of times we tend to write down application on journal and sometimes, we tend to forget to push out those applications. Sometimes we add it to google calendar but alot of times we get overwhelmed with trying to keep up with all the applications added. At the end of the year most times, we look back at our growth and try to reflect on the job applications and events or fellowships we've applied to and sometimes we give an estimated number. Won't it be nice to actually have the correct figures of all these? 

### Solution
That is the main goal of tracker. A web app that enables user to keep track of their applications. 
It also enables users to add their applications and keep track of them. Tracker helps users to store their applications and ensure that they get back to them through timely email reminders (though this is still a feature in progress at the moment).
